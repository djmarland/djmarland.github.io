    HTML5, CSS3

# NOTES

    This website is supposed to be as small as I can make it.
    It uses few classes as there is only one of most elements
    It won't look the same in every (old) browser, but that is intentional.
    If you support the fancy stuff, you'll get the fancy stuff.
    I'm not even using normalize, so it's definitely different in every browser.
